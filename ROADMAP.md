Development Roadmap
===================

This roadmap outlines the phased development plan for S.A.M., ensuring a structured approach to building its core functionalities while remaining adaptive to future enhancements.

* * * * *

**Phase 1: Core Backend**
-------------------------

The foundation of S.A.M., focusing on building the essential backend systems to support core functionality.

-   **AI Engine Integration**:

    -   Connect to GPT (via OpenAI API) for language understanding and response generation.
    -   Establish a modular architecture to allow future enhancements and model updates.
-   **Task Management**:

    -   Enable input and storage of tasks.
    -   Implement a system for breaking tasks into manageable subtasks.
    -   Develop a prioritization algorithm based on urgency, importance, and user context.
-   **Emotion Detection**:

    -   Use sentiment analysis to detect emotional states in text-based interactions.
    -   Begin responding with basic empathetic and supportive prompts.

* * * * *

**Phase 2: Feedback Loop**
--------------------------

Introduce mechanisms to personalize S.A.M. for each user and improve over time.

-   **User Feedback**:

    -   Implement a feedback system (e.g., thumbs up/down) to collect insights on interaction quality.
    -   Store feedback for refining S.A.M.'s behavior and accuracy.
-   **Data Storage**:

    -   Set up a database to store user preferences, interaction history, and task progress.
    -   Enable persistent context for smoother multi-session interactions.

* * * * *

**Phase 3: Emotional Intelligence**
-----------------------------------

Enhance S.A.M.'s ability to recognize, understand, and respond to user emotions.

-   **Refined Emotion Detection**:

    -   Upgrade sentiment analysis models for more nuanced emotional recognition.
    -   Tailor responses to different emotional states (e.g., overwhelmed, excited, anxious).
-   **Supportive Features**:

    -   Introduce grounding techniques such as breathing exercises or motivational prompts.
    -   Provide dynamic suggestions based on detected emotional needs (e.g., taking breaks, focusing on small wins).

* * * * *

**Phase 4: Expansion**
----------------------

Expand S.A.M.'s capabilities for broader accessibility and real-world integrations.

-   **WebUI**:

    -   Develop a user-friendly interface for broader accessibility.
    -   Integrate visualization features, like interactive neural maps.
-   **Third-Party Integrations**:

    -   Connect S.A.M. to external tools such as calendars, email, or productivity apps.
    -   Enable seamless task automation and external data retrieval.

* * * * *

**Future Considerations**
-------------------------

This roadmap is flexible and will evolve based on user feedback, technological advancements, and project growth. Future updates may include:

-   Voice-to-text interactions with emotional tone detection.
-   Integration with wearable devices for real-time biometric feedback.
-   Advanced learning algorithms for deeper personalization.
